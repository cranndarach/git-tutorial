# ~Getting~ Gitting Started

>Initialize a repository and make your first commit.

## About this tutorial

This tutorial covers git for command line, and assumes that you have git 
installed on your computer. If you do not, you can [find it here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

On Windows, make sure to include the command-line tools and enable support for
MinTTY.

It will also assume you have some folder that you will use as your "project 
folder" for the purpose of this tutorial. It's okay if it is empty.

## Initializing a repository

Git repositories are stored within your project's main folder or **root 
directory**. To start a repository, you will need to open your project's root 
directory from a terminal. 

### OSX & Linux

On Mac, you can find the application called "Terminal" in your Applications 
folder. On Linux, it varies, but you can probably find in the HUD by 
pressing the Super key and searching for "Terminal," or directly by pressing
`Ctrl-Alt-T` (this typically works on Ubuntu-based systems, at least).

When you have the terminal open, **change directories** into the project's 
root. To do this, type `cd path/to/project/directory`, replacing 
`path/to/project/directory` with the actual path to the directory. Hint: Your 
terminal most likely opens to a directory called `~`, also known as the 
**home directory**, which contains folders like `Documents` and `Desktop`. You
can type `ls` to see what is in a folder at any time. You can also type the 
first few characters (to the point where the name is unique) and hit the tab
key to complete it. You may also be able to drag-and-drop the name of the 
folder from the file explorer (e.g., Finder or Nautilus).

### Windows

Open the project folder in your file explorer. Right click, and select "Git 
Bash here."
