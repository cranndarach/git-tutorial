# Branching, forking, and merging

## Branching

A somewhat more advanced feature of git, but still very important, is branching.
Branching allows you to duplicate a repository at one point in history, and
make changes in one copy that are not reflected in another. This adds a layer of
security and makes it easier to mess around without worrying about breaking your
project.

First, you may want to see all of the branches that are currently in your repo.
To do this, run

```shell
git branch
```
