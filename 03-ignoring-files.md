# 3. Ignoring files

Sometimes you will have files that you do not want to track. They might be logs, output from programs, or contain sensitive information. It is a little
annoying to have these files show up when you run `git status`, and it can clutter up the visual space and make you miss important files that you *did* mean to
commit. Fortunately, there are two main ways to tell git not to track certain files: `.gitignore` and `.git/info/exclude`.

Any file name that you add to either of those files will be ignored in `git status` output and will not be committed.

## .gitignore

First, let's make a file to ignore. In a text editor, create a file called something like `ignore-me.txt`, and have it say something like "This is some
sensitive data that should not end up in a repository!" (If you're feeling fancy, run `echo "This is some sensitive data that should not end up in a
repository!" > ignore-me.txt` instead.)

Now run `git status`. Since we haven't told git to ignore that file yet, you should see it listed. Now let's change that.

In a text editor, create a file called `.gitignore` â€” the "." is important!

Write `ignore-me.txt` in it. You can add as many files as you want, as well as regular expressions (e.g., `*.log`), each on its own line. When you're done,
save and exit.

Now run `git status` again. You shouldn't see `ignore-me.txt` listed anymore, but you should see `.gitignore`. It is customary to commit `.gitignore` to your
repository so that in the future, you or others won't have to re-write it.

`.gitignore` works just like any other file in terms of git workflow. When you change it, you will want to stage and commit it.

## .git/info/exclude

The exclude file works just like `.gitignore`, but it is actually within the git repository's configuration files. You can find it at `.git/info/excludes`.
Since changes you make to this file are made directly to the repository itself, not in the project's directory, you do not need to commit it. But, it stays
with your local repository and is not pushed to a remote.

Whereas `.gitignore` is typically used for "junk" files that are generated in the process of developing your project (e.g., `__pycache__` or `*.[oa]`), the
exclude file is more for files that are irrelevant to the project, or files that you have license to use but not to share.

A good rule of thumb is that if you think it could apply to someone else too, put it in the `.gitignore`. Otherwise, put it in the exclude file.

## Globally excluding files

If there are some patterns that you want to exclude by default from every repository you make, you could make a global exclude file.

To do this, you'd first make a file in your home directory (`~`) or configuration directory (`~/.config`) called something like `.gitexclude-global` (the name
is up to you).

Then tell git where to find it by running:

```sh
git config --global core.excludesfile="~/.gitexclude-global"
```
